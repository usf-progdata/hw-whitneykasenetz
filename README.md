# **About the Author**
## Hello, my name is Whitney and I use she/her pronouns! :tada:
 I am an undergraduate student studying Psychology with a minor in Applied Behavior Analysis. I have plans to go to graduate school for neuroscience, and I have a particular interest in identifying the neural mechanisms that underlie Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD. For now, I'm just working on finishing my B.A. and getting some experience in a research lab. You can learn more about my professional life and connect with me  [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/whitney-kasenetz-16716119a/). 
Additionally, I play music. You can click the link below to see me ```~in action~```

  I play on my own now, but I was in a band before covid. Here's my favorite song from Rude Dingo's [album](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6UwKAHx0TKLMBsag19tm6k). I also really enjoy woodworking and hanging out with my dog.
