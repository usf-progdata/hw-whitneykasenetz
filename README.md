* assignments
* a final project

## Navigating the Repository 

<!-- Don't think of branches like _locations_, think of them as different points in _time_. When you make a new branch to work on an assignment, that's a _temporary_ timeline where you can make changes to files separately from the master copies. Once you've merged that branch back into master, delete the temporary working branch. -->

<!-- In terms of organizing your repo, please create a _folder_ named 'hw01', 'hw02', etc. for each assignment that will contain all of the files for that assignment. -->

In this repository, I have a [master](https://github.com/usf-progdata/hw-whitneykasenetz/tree/master) branch and another branch for the first [homework](https://github.com/usf-progdata/hw-whitneykasenetz/tree/hw01) assignment. I will update this page as I add more branches.

## Hello, my name is Whitney! :tada: My pronouns are *she/her* 
 I am an undergraduate student studying Psychology with a minor in Applied Behavior Analysis. I have plans to go to graduate school for neuroscience, and I have a particular interest in identifying the neural mechanisms that underlie Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD. For now, I'm just working on finishing my B.A. and getting some experience in a research lab. You can learn more about my professional life and connect with me  [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/whitney-kasenetz-16716119a/). 
In my free time, I like to play and write music. You can click the link below to see me ```~in action~```

  I play on my own now, but I was in a band before covid. Here's my favorite song from Rude Dingo's [album](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6UwKAHx0TKLMBsag19tm6k). If I'm not studying or playing music, I'm probably working on some woodworking project in my garage or at the park with my dog. 
  
  Lastly, Here's a music [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6TEtPJxx8hy9Vog5c3MZ3n) I'm working on. 
  
  <!-- Nice list! -->
