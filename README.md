# **About the author**
## Hello, my name is Whitney and I use she/her pronouns! :tada:
### I am currently wrapping up my B.A. in Psychology with a minor in Applied Behavior Analysis. I have plans to go to graduate school for neuroscience, and I have a particular interest in identifying the neural mechanisms that underlie Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD. For now, I'm just getting some experience in a research lab. You can learn more about my professional life and connect with me  [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/whitney-kasenetz-16716119a/). 
#### Additionally, I play music. You can click the link below to see me ```~in action~```
